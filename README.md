👋 Hey, I’m David

I build production-grade systems that sit at the intersection of data engineering, backend platforms, and product.

Most days you’ll find me:
	•	Designing scalable data pipelines (Spark, Airflow, Snowflake)
	•	Shipping backend services in Kotlin / Spring Boot
	•	Building marketplaces & fintech-adjacent products
	•	Obsessing over clean abstractions, idempotency, and systems that don’t page you at 3am

I care deeply about robustness, clarity, and shipping things that actually get used.<!---
